Q28,"<h2><span style=""font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"">Open Science survey 2025</span></h2>
 

<p><span style=""font-size:19px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"">At Leiden University we're working to make Open Science the norm. </span></span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style=""font-size:19px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"">Are you involved in conducting, teaching, advising on, or supporting research related activities at Leiden University? Your input on this survey will help shape the future and the practical steps taken to engage and support you. </span></span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style=""font-size:19px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"">Why? This survey aims to assess the level of engagement with Open Science at Leiden University, and to identify ways we can develop and improve. We will use the results to improve available resources and services in line with your needs. For instance those offered by the Open Science Community Leiden (OSCL) and the university-wide Academia in Motion programme (AiM).</span></span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style=""font-size:19px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"">Why me? In order to get a broad view on Open Science at Leiden University, we need a broad range of perspectives. Your participation helps no matter your level of familiarity with or interest in Open Science. The results will allow us to compare Open Science engagement to a similar survey done in 2023, and learn how we've collectively developed since then. At the end of this survey, you will receive a sneak peak into the current results to show you how your participation contributes to our larger goal.</span></span><br>
 </p>

<p><span style=""font-size:19px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"">What? The survey will take about 5 to 10 minutes to complete. You will answer questions about what Open Science means to you.</span></span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style=""font-size:19px;""><span style=""font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"">How. Responses are collected anonymously in Qualtrics. You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information. Therefore, once responses have been submitted, you will not be able to withdraw your responses from the survey. The questions are very broad and there is little risk of re-identifying a person based on the responses. We intend to archive and openly share the anonymous data, so that results can be reused and reproduced by anyone. Before making data open, any potential identifying text from open ended responses will be removed. By continuing to the survey, you are consenting to future publication of the anonymous survey responses.</span></span></p>
